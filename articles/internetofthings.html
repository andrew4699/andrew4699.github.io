						If my parents were asked in the 1990s about the possibility of thermostats, printers, and refrigerators connecting to the Internet, they would have been skeptical. But now that once unimaginable idea is a reality brought about by technological advancements. The Internet has evolved greatly since its inception. The sheer impact it has in our everyday lives is immense. While much of the impact is positive, the magnitude of distress it can include is often overlooked.
					</p>

					<p>
						Security vulnerabilities are not unique to the Internet. Private security companies are employed to protect physical property, and seen as a necessity for large buildings such as museums, malls, and hotels. Intellectual property is undoubtedly more valuable than physical property. So why do we not employ the same level of protection when considering intellectual property?
					</p>

					<p>
						Simple devices, such as cameras and DVR players, now have access to the Internet. Their capabilities appear negligible, but were proven otherwise on October 21st, when Dyn was struck by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. According to data gathered by Arbor, an Internet security company, approximately 2900 DDoS attacks occur each day, so what made this one important? The attacker used appliances, such as cameras and DVR players, to flood the Internet performance management company's servers, cutting access to hundreds of services for several hours. The Guardian reported that the attack may have been "roughly twice as powerful as any similar attack on record."
					</p>

					<p>
						While the Dyn attack caused much distress for the average American attempting to connect to the Internet on October 21st, it also served as a wake-up call that we must step up our security or these types of attacks will only become more prevalent.
					</p>

					<p>
						Ending this growing epidemic requires the dismissal of a common belief among Americans. The notion that the contribution of one person does not carry weight is untrue. The Internet of Things is shaped by those who use it, and those that do play equal roles in shaping it. Each device left exposed — whether it be a computer, phone, printer, or refrigerator — is essentially a soft clump of clay which hackers can mold to serve their malicious intents.
					</p>

					<p>
						So how do we defend against these startling vulnerabilities? While many manufacturers already work with one or more of the countless Internet security companies around the world, others have slack to pick up. As such, many of the aforementioned devices have features that must be manually set-up to protect against these vulnerabilities, leaving them unsecured by default. People overlook the security features because they are often buried under the myriad of features that marketing teams work so hard to emphasize. Rather than leaving it up the the customer, manufacturers need to set secure settings by default. 
					</p>

					<p>
						I personally plan to integrate security systems to protect my personal and business assets. I plan to employ solutions such as PKI for the Internet of Things, CloudFlare, and other various security tools to ensure the safekeeping of my sensitive information.
					</p>

					<p>
						When websites are not offline due to DDoS attacks, they serve as platforms where people can exchange information rapidly and express ideas freely. The Internet is present in the majority of our daily routines. Emergency services use it to dispatch units to respond to critical situations, which is just one of the Internet's many uses.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Internet can and will expand. According to DigiCert, an estimated 25 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020. As a society, we need to lessen the vulnerabilities imposed on our credit cards and childhood photos by taking measures to heighten our security on the Internet.
